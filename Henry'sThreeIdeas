1. The coin can be "bit" with a Bite function. Biting has a small chance of occurring every transaction, and it removes 10% of all 
BLT in circulation. A bite would happen on average every week.

2. The coin can be "barked" at with a Bark function. Any user has the ability to select the ability to bark during a transaction. Barking has a
chance to "scare" the transaction, which lowers gas price, but it can also "enrage" the transaction, which raises gas price. (this would use
tx.gasprice)

3. Barking sometimes grants a user a "Leash" NFT which they can exchange for one use of the TakeOnWalk fucntion. TheTakeOnWalk function changes the sender
of that user's transaction to me for one time. This means that no matter how much money they send to someone else in the transaction, I am that is doing
the sending. If I don't have enough I mint more. (this would use tx.origin)
